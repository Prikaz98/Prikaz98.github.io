        The main consuming resources of an IT company is an electricity.
        <br>
        I have a few thoughts how can we improve an environmental friendliness:
        <h3>Turn off office computer after work</h3>

             width="350"
             height="210"
             style="">
        Although in the modern computers sleep mode is really effectively save a power
        whatever to turn off the office device is a good habit to save a electricity
        and it is better for environment.

        <h3>Setup minimal time for turning to sleep mode</h3>
        It is related with previous take and need to decrease hot working time.
        The difference between <q>in use</q> and <q>sleep mode</q> might be in 30 times.
        <br>

        <h3>Implement software that consume less resources</h3>

        Nowadays web development became a very huge and heavy. The average web page size might
        weight a several megabytes. And it is not a problem if there is just a content,
        but unfortunately the most part of this size is a JavaScript code.
        <br>
        When your browser receives a JavaScript code, the browser has to recognize it
        and that is not free.

        Eventually, just internet surfing through overloaded (by JavaScript) web pages can
        spend your battery life and you have to more often charge your computer.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is a good example when care about environment was a cause of changing
        established approach. It happened in blockchain technology.

        Long story short...
        Instead of perform calculation by everyone (who first finished a calculation will win),
        we developed mechanism that determine who will perform a calculation. That allows us
        to spend less resources for maintaining existing systems.
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        It is just a tip of the iceberg what we can do to be more eco-friendly. Also
        I am happy to know that now more people cares about our planet and
        highlight problem which we have. I also see that fashion is changing and developers
        find ways to make things more efficiently and simple.
