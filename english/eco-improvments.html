        The main resource consumed by an IT company is electricity.
        Here are a few thoughts on how we can improve environmental friendliness:
      </p>

      <h3>Turn off office computers after work</h3>
      <img

        src="power-off-768x512.jpg"
        style="padding-left:10px"
        width="350">
      <p>
        Although modern computers have highly efficient sleep modes that save power,
        turning off office devices completely is a good habit to conserve electricity
        and reduce environmental impact.
      </p>

      <h3>Set a minimal time for switching to sleep mode</h3>
      <p>
        This is closely related to the previous point and aims to reduce the duration
        of devices running at full power unnecessarily. The power consumption difference
        between <q>in use</q> and <q>sleep mode</q> can be as much as 30 times.
      </p>

      <h3>Implement software that consume fewer resources</h3>

        style="padding-left:10px"
        width="350">

      <p>
        Modern web development has become increasingly resource-intensive. The average
        web page can be several megabytes in size. While content contributes to this,
        a significant portion of the size often comes from JavaScript code.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a browser processes JavaScript, it consumes computational resources,
        which is not energy-efficient.

        As a result, simply surfing the web through JavaScript-heavy websites can
        drain your device&apos;s battery more quickly, requiring more frequent
        recharges.
      </p>

      <p>
        There&apos;s a great example of how environmental concerns have driven change
        in technology - blockchain.

        Long story short, instead of having every participant perform calculations
        (with the winner being the first to finish), a new mechanism was developed
        to determine who will perform the calculations. This drastically reduces
        the resources required to maintain such systems.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        These are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we can do to be more
        eco-friendly. It&apos;s encouraging to see that more people care about our planet
        and are addressing the problems we face. I&apos;m also happy to see that trends
        are shifting, with developers finding ways to create more efficient and
        simpler solutions.
