          We spent a lot of time clearly defining our target audience. Let me describe the
          kind of companies we focus on.

          First, imagine a visionary who takes out a huge loan from the bank. With this money, they
          rent an office, buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee, and stock up on eight boxes of Johnnie Walker
          Blue Label whiskey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the whiskey runs out, the Jeep is wrecked, the office trashed from
          countless parties, but the loan still needs to be repaid. So, they take out a new loan -
          three times bigger than the first. This new loan is used to pay off the old one, and once
          again they buy another Jeep and this time, sixteen boxes of Chivas Regal Royal.

          This cycle continues until the businessman eventually declares bankruptcy.

          You might ask, "What does this have to do with advertising?" Well, here's the key point:
        </p>

        <p>
          Right around the time when half the whiskey is still left, the Jeep is still running, and
          thoughts of bankruptcy haven’t crossed their mind yet, something happens. At this moment,
          the businessman starts feeling unstoppable and grand ideas come to mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s when they decide to order an advertising product - one that must be cooler and more
          extravagant than what their competitors have. Typically, this ad costs about a third of
          each loan they've taken.
        </p>

        <p>
          And right at that moment, when the idea strikes, our agency appears like a genie and
          offers
          them exactly what they're looking for.
