      <h1>Scala Development with Emacs</h1>
    </div>

    <h2>Prelude</h2>

    <p>
      I'm a Scala developer and an active Emacs user.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      This note is dedicated to things I've noticed while working with
      Scala in a plain-text development environment. To find out why I
      use Emacs you can check this remark<br>
      <a href="../emacs-journey/emacs-journey.html">
	My Journey from IntelliJ IDEA to Minimal Configuration Emacs</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Work with Scala Code Without a Powerful IDE?</h2>

    <p>
      During my journey, I discovered that I could solve most of the
      annoying Scala development problems on my own or by using Emacs
      extensions.
    </p>

    <h3>Imports (Search, Sort, Remove Unused)</h3>

    <p>
      I'm not
      using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol">LSP</a>,
      but I needed a function that suggests imports to add. I decided to solve
      this problem in the simplest way possible: I wrote a function that greps
      source files and collects all existing imports into a cache file for
      instant access.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm very proud of this extension because I don’t need anything
      except grep to achieve a similar experience to find import in a
      smart IDE.
    </p>

      src="./scalai-find-imports.gif"/>

    <p>
      As part of this
      extension, <a href="https://github.com/Prikaz98/office-utils/blob/master/scalai.el">scalai.el</a>,
      I also wrote additional functions to optimize and check unused imports,
      which helps me during editing.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Rename/Refactoring</h3>
    
    <p>
      I like how the built-in query-replace in Emacs works - it gives you complete
      control over what you are changing. However, it's not always suitable for
      more complex edits. Fortunately, Emacs has an amazing
      extension, <a href="https://github.com/dajva/rg.el">rg.el</a>, which
      allows you to find all occurrences across files and edit them
      interactively inside the search results buffer.      
    </p>

    <img
      class="img-wrapper"
      src="./scala-ripgrep.gif">

    <p>
      This kind of refactoring lets you perform almost any edit as you would in
      a regular buffer. It's awesome!
    </p>

    <h3>Auto-Completion</h3>
    <p>
      I found that simple text auto-completion covers all my needs, making a
      full-fledged LSP unnecessary. I
      use <a href="https://company-mode.github.io/">company.el</a> - it's
      smooth, fast, and highly configurable.
    </p>

    <h3>Go to Definition</h3>

    <p>
      I’m comfortable just using grep/rg or navigating to a file by class name.
      There aren’t many extra benefits beyond remembering file locations and
      project structure. In demo I
      used <a href="https://github.com/hvesalai/emacs-sbt-mode">sbt-mode.el</a>
    </p>

    <h2>What Changes Have I Noticed with Plain Text Development?</h2>
    
    <h3>Easier to Switch Between Feature Branches</h3>

    <p>
      No need to recalculate indexes or invalidate caches. Just switch the
      branch and start editing instantly. <b>sbt clean compile</b>
    </p>

    <h3>More Thoughtful Naming of Functions and Variables</h3>

    <p>
      Since I rely on text search tools, I pay more attention to naming
      functions and fields carefully to avoid cases where different entities
      have the same name.
    </p>

    <h3>Better Awareness of Imports</h3>

    <p>
      By default, IDEs hide imports, which I believe is a bad approach,
      especially for inexperienced developers. I've seen junior developers fix
      errors by adding random imports, only to later ask why their code isn't
      working. When I pointed out that they had used the wrong imports, they
      were surprised.
    </p>

    <img
      class="img-wrapper"
      src="./intellij-imports.png"/>

    <p>
      Manually managing imports can also make code more readable. Scala has a
      great feature called "scoped importing," which allows you to import
      directly within a class/method/function scope.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is especially helpful when working with boilerplate-heavy models,
      such as Scala GRPC protobuf views.
    </p>

    <p>
      Example:
      <pre>
        <code>
<label class="keyword">import</label> grpc.{<label class="class">Drink</label>, <label class="class">Food</label>, <label class="class">Order</label>}

<label class="keyword">def</label> <label class="function">extractCustomer</label>(order: <label class="class">Order</label>): <label class="class">String</label> = {
  <label class="keyword">import</label> grpc.<label class="class">Order</label>.<label class="class">Data</label>

  order <label class="keyword">match</label> {
    <label class="keyword">case</label> <label class="class">Data</label>.<label class="class">Drink</label>(drink) => extractFromDrink(drink)
    <label class="keyword">case</label> <label class="class">Data</label>.<label class="class">Food</label>(food) => extractFromFood(food)
  }
}

<label class="keyword">private def</label> <label class="function">extractFromDrink</label>(drink: <label class="class">Drink</label>): <label class="class">String</label> = {
  <label class="keyword">import</label> grpc.<label class="class">Drink</label>.<label class="class">Data</label>

  drink <label class="keyword">match</label> {
    <label class="keyword">case</label> <label class="class">Data</label>.<label class="class">Tea</label>(tea) => tea.drinker
    <label class="keyword">case</label> <label class="class">Data</label>.<label class="class">Coffee</label>(coffee) => coffee.drinker
  }
}

<label class="keyword">private def</label> <label class="function">extractFromFood</label>(food: <label class="class">Food</label>): <label class="class">String</label> = {
  <label class="keyword">import</label> grpc.<label class="class">Food</label>.<label class="class">Data</label>

  food <label class="keyword">match</label> {
    <label class="keyword">case</label> <label class="class">Data</label>.<label class="class">Fish</label>(fish) => fish.eater
    <label class="keyword">case</label> <label class="class">Data</label>.<label class="class">Vegetables</label>(veg) => veg.eater
  }
}</code>
      </pre>        

      <h3>Avoiding Common Bugs</h3>

    <p>
      I don't try to keep everything in my head. When I need to use a class or
      function, I look for existing code snippets. This either helps me recall
      how to use them or teaches me something new. If I don’t fully understand
      what’s happening, I read the official documentation or check the library
      sources.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      This approach helps avoid common mistakes, such as forgetting to close
      resources or handling errors improperly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, this method has its downsides. If the code snippet I find
      contains bugs, I might end up replicating them. However, by checking
      multiple occurrences, I can compare and identify inconsistencies.
    </p>

    <h3>Paying More Attention to Compile Logs</h3>
    <p>
      When I used an IDE, I generally ignored compile logs because I relied on
      the IDE to highlight errors. Now, I make an effort to keep my compile logs
      clean and fix warnings as well.
    </p>

    <h3>Increased Focus on Unit Tests</h3>

    <p>
      This applies to any language I use. I’m never fully confident that my code is
      correct because I’ve seen too many cases where either I or my coworkers were
      too self-assured and made mistakes. Now, I like to think about new code this
      way:
    </p>
    <p>"Does this code work?" – Hell if I know. Let’s run it!</p>
