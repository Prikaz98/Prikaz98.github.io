      <h1>A Brief Article About the Lem Editor</h1>
    </div>


    <h3>Prelude</h3>
    <p>
      I like Emacs it&apos;s extensibility is amazing, but every I've noticed
      that to implement some new features that related with some of UI elements
      might be very difficult - becuase you need to support a few different way
      to show user data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like how it work in <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a>
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>(<label class="keyword">defcustom</label> projectile-completion-system 'auto
          <label class="s-literal">"The completion system to be used by Projectile."</label>
          :group 'projectile
          :type '(radio
                 (const :tag <label class="s-literal">&quot;Auto-detect&quot;</label> auto)
                 (const :tag <label class="s-literal">&quot;Ido&quot;</label> ido)
                 (const :tag <label class="s-literal">&quot;Helm&quot;</label> helm)
                 (const :tag <label class="s-literal">&quot;Ivy&quot;</label> ivy)
                 (const :tag <label class="s-literal">&quot;Default&quot;</label> default)
                 (function :tag <label class="s-literal">&quot;Custom function&quot;</label>)))</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      And I didn't find any attempts to implement an editor with benefits of
      Emacs with <i>good customization opporutnity and extensibility</i> and modern
      editorls like VSCode with <i>stable core set of build-in features and UI
      components</i>.

    </p>

    <h3>Good Customization Opporutnities</h3>
    <p>
      There are many editors that allow you to write extensions, but their
      design doesn&apos;t make it as simple as it is in Programmable Editor like
      Emacs or Lem (write a function &rarr; feed it to the editor &rarr; run).
      This is especially true when you need to perform tasks that require
      hard-coded logic.
    </p>

      class="img-wrapper"
      src="./editors.png">

    <p>
      For example, I sometimes prepare Jira task in Emacs because it&apos;s more
      comfortable than using Jira&apos;s web form. When I need to create a task, I
      just call a function
      <pre>
        <code>(<label class="keyword">defun</label> jira-create-new-task (title)
            <label class="s-literal">&quot;Create template file for tasks.&quot;</label>
            (<label class="keyword">interactive</label> <label class="s-literal">&quot;sEnter titile: \n&quot;</label>)
            ...)</code>
      </pre>
      by <a href="https://github.com/Prikaz98/office-utils/blob/master/jira.el">jira.el</a>.
      Which I developed myself. <br><br>
      Emacs then prompts me to write a title, saves the file
      in a special directory and with special name, and after editing, I convert the
      org-mode format to Jira format and copy it in the clipboard,
      automatically, in fly. There&apos;s no reason to solve this problem in modern
      editors like VS Code because it&apos;s highly specific personal workflow.
    </p>

    <h3>A Stable Set of Build-in Features</h3>
    <p>
      Emacs has been around for over 40 years, and during that time, certain
      features have become essential for almost everyone. If we look at  MELPA&apos;s
      packages list and sort it by downloads, we can see that the most popular
      packages are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a> - Git client for Emacs</li>
      <li><a href="https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/">Helm</a> - Fuzzy finding, file completions, and more</li>
      <li><a href="https://company-mode.github.io/">Company-mode</a> - Text completions</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/">Flycheck</a> - Syntax checking</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html">Dired</a> - File manager (a build-in package but extremely popular)</li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs">Treemacs</a> or
        <a href="https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree">Neotree</a> - Project sidebar tree</li>
      <li><a href="https://evil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#installation-via-package-el">Evil</a> - Vim keybindings for Emacs</li>
      <li>(lang)-mode - Basic programing language support (indentation, syntax highlighting)</li>
      <li><a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/installation/">Lsp</a> - Integration with Language Server Protocol</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a> - Project management and navigation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I believe these features like are widely used because they significantly
      increase productivity. So why not combine them into an editor by default
      and allows community to build their own features on top of a solid core
      API? (fortunately it happened in Lem)
    </p>

    <h2>Why Lem is awesome!</h2>
    <img src="lem.svg" alt="" />
    <p>
      <a href="https://lem-project.github.io/">Lem</a>
      is an editor designed to address these needs.
    </p>

    <img class="img-wrapper"
         src="./lem-demo.gif"/>

    <p>
      When I first launched it, I immediately felt at home. Everything works
      naturally for Emacs user - but better. The defaults, like find-file,
      execute-command, dashboard (instead of splash screen that most people
      disable anyway :D) all felt intuitive. I&apos;ve already contributed a few
      things in Lem project, and I love how easy it is. Common Lisp is a
      fantastic language for an extensible editor.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my favorite features is that Lem can run like a regular GUI App -
      just like I prefer in Emacs.
    </p>

    <h3>Out-of-the-box features in Lem:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Dashboard
        <img class="img-wrapper" src="./lem-dashboard.png">
      </li>
      <li>
        Auto-complition
        <img class="img-wrapper" src="./lem-autocomplete.png">
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiple-cursors
        <img class="img-wrapper" src="./lem-multicursors.png">
      </li>
      <li>
        Directory mode
        <img class="img-wrapper" src="./lem-directory.png">
      </li>
      <li>
        Project commands
        <img class="img-wrapper" src="./lem-project-function.png">
      </li>
      <li>
        Legit
        <img class="img-wrapper" src="./lem-legit.png">
      </li>
      <li>
        Workspackes (frame-multiplexer)
        <img class="img-wrapper" src="./lem-workspaces.png">
      </li>
      <li>
        Polyglot editor (Lem support a huge number of programming languages)
        <img class="img-wrapper" src="./lem-any-lang.png">
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      also Tabs, Copilot, LSP and all of this is available  out of the box.
    </p>

    <p>
      I see Lem as an evolution of Emacs/Vim editor and I hope the project
      continues to grow and improve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for reading, and happy hacking!
