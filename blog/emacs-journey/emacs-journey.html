      <h1>From IntelliJ IDEA to Minimal Emacs</h1>
    </div>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>My career launched at a company where everybody used IntelliJ IDEA. There
      were developers who had already been working for a decade and had seen
      Java IDEs like Eclipse come and go. Using IntelliJ was the default option
      because there were no other viable tools for Scala/Java development.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I started working at this company, I was a completely junior
      developer. I didn&apos;t have a degree in a related field or much
      practical experience. Naturally, I didn&apos;t question why my team used
      IntelliJ IDEA or why I should use it - it worked, and it was good enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      But as I explored more of the IT and open-source world, I discovered Vim.
      Its approach to navigating text blew my mind. Once I became more
      comfortable with Vim motions, I installed plugins for every application I
      used, like DBeaver, IntelliJ, Chrome, etc.
    </p>

      />

    <p>
      At that point, I thought, &quot;OK, I have a very efficient IDE, and I have a
      very efficient navigation. There&apos;s nothing left to surprise me.&quot; Then
      I encountered Emacs. It wasn&apos;t love at first sight.
      While I could see that Emacs was a cool and powerful tool, I didn&apos;t
      initially understand how to use it effectively for modern development.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Emacs?</h3>
    <p>
      Time passed, and I changed jobs. At my new workplace, I was tasked with
      editing a huge configuration file. I started doing it manually but quickly
      realized I was essentially executing an algorithm by hand. Using Java or
      Scala to automate the process wasn&apos;t practical because I would need
      to deserialize the configuration into Java objects, manipulate them, and
      then serialize them back into a file, losing the sorting and developer
      comments in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, I remembered Emacs. I realized I could write a function to
      automate the changes programmatically. I installed Emacs on my laptop,
      wrote the function, and completed the task quickly, with minimal git
      changes that were easy for others to review.
    </p>

      />

    <p>
      This experience showed me the power of a programmable editor. From that
      point on, I started using Emacs. At first, it was just an additional text
      editor for files that IntelliJ didn&apos;t support. But after discovering
      Doom Emacs, everything changed. I started using Doom Emacs as my main
      editor for working on all projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      During this time, I discovered Magit, Dired, Restclient, Org-mode, and
      other fantastic Emacs tools. After that, there was no turning back.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most incredible thing I found in the Emacs ecosystem is that every
      application strives to be as simple as possible. Each time I discovered a
      new app that solved a problem, I was amazed at how elegant the solution
      was.
    <p>

      <h3>Back to the origins</h3>
    <p>
      But the story doesn&apos;t end there. I was still using Evil-mode (Vim
      motions in Emacs).
    </p>

    <p>
      Evil-mode is an excellent extension, but I sometimes noticed that some
      applications didn&apos;t work well with it. You still needed to know
      vanilla Emacs keybindings, and things didn&apos;t always work as smoothly
      as they could.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, I decided to learn vanilla Emacs. To be honest, I had tried
      using vanilla Emacs before, but those attempts failed because I was trying
      to recreate my own version of Doom Emacs (I believed that I need those all
      features which Doom Emacs offers). This time, I focused on keeping
      everything as simple as possible, adding new features only when absolutely
      necessary. I either wrote custom solutions or installed packages only when
      Emacs built-in features couldn&apos;t handle the task.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot has changed since then, and I love it. No more modal editing. Every
      change I make is visible immediately in the continuous event loop, without
      the need to predict or remember Vim commands. I can use the minibuffer
      like any other buffer without breaking my typing flow, and the experience
      is incredible.

      (To solve the &apos;pinkie finger problem&apos;, I remapped LEFT ALT as
      LEFT CTRL. Now, my right thumb presses ALT, and my left thumb presses
      CTRL)
