Software Engineer with 3 years of experience with Scala. The majority of the time I was involved in the maintenance, release and development of Financial projects. During my work I try to keep the code clean and testable and to always apply approaches to minimize unexpected behaviors. I have analyzed customer requests, offered a solution, decomposed it into sub-tasks and estimated them.
